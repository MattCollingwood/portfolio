                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Based in Maryland, I graduated from Towson University with a degree in Mass Communication. Since then, I’ve spent over a decade navigating the dynamic world of marketing and client management. My professional journey has taken me from supporting local businesses to partnering with global marketing agencies, managing diverse campaigns and client needs across the full spectrum of marketing services.</p>
                <p>Over time, I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical side of my engagements—supporting engineering teams on complex projects such as Customer Data Platform (CDP) migrations, Salesforce implementations, cloud storage solutions, and responsive web development. These experiences sparked a deep curiosity and passion for the engineering side of the work, ultimately inspiring me to dive into programming myself.</p>
                <p>After dedicating over a year to learning how to code and building my own projects, I’m excited to pivot my career from client services to software engineering. I bring with me a unique blend of strategic communication skills, marketing experience, and a growing technical toolkit—ready to contribute to teams building smart, scalable solutions.</p>
